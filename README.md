# Versioning with Tyk

Example versioning with Tyk

Aside: it's pronounced "tike" like "bike", and apparently CoPilot knows that as it suggested it after I typed pronounced.

## Setup

The script `run.sh` will:

1. start Tyk
2. checkout the `v1` branch of the code
3. deploy the API to Tyk
4. pause for you to test the API and look at the code

This will be repeated for the `v1.1` and `v2` branches.
